## 🤤 usage

to install the library as a dependency to your project, run

```bash
yarn add contribution-heatmap
# or, according to your preference
npm install contribution-heatmap
```

import the library in your project like below, and you can get started using it directly.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```tsx
// simply import the library, no css-imports needed
import { Heatmap } from "contribution-heatmap"
// and then ... just use it like you would any components
export const YourComponent = () => <Heatmap 
    colour={['#ebedf0', '#c6e48b', '#40c463', '#30a14e', '#216e39']} 
    squareNumber={5} 
    count={[3, 2, 20, 1, 14]}
    squareGap='4px'
    squareSize='15px'
/>
```

<!--prettier-ignore-end -->

more details on props will come soon. I am making progress, albeit rather slowly—many things are happening lately.
